## Download
Please head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/kerastinell/Metro-X3/releases).

## Install
*Tested and proved working on Ubuntu 18.04 with GNOME 3.28.2*

Copy any directory with cursors (for example, `X3 Indigo (Bold)`) to `~/.icons/`. Cursor theme will now appear in GNOME Tweaks program. Log out and log in to your user account after you select a new cursor.

## Manual generation
This repository includes a `bash` script in case you'd like to generate X11 cursors yourself.

#### Required packages
`find imagemagick xxd sed libxcursor*`

You'll also need to build and install `ani2ico`:
```
git clone https://github.com/paddygord/cursor-converter
cd cursor-converter/ani2ico
rm ani2ico && make && sudo cp -v ani2ico /usr/bin/
```

#### Preparation
Download the .zip archive with Windows cursors. I used the archive from exsess' DeviantArt, but it requires an account.
SHA256 of the source archive I used is `1ad1572235c8c3aff5607d5cf26e1d96d2c76b033fc8796d79cb4af5d9ed89b9`.
Unpack the archive to some directory.

#### Running the script
Run the `generate_cursors.sh` and specify the root directory (where `Readme.txt` and `Preview.jpg` reside) of unpacked .zip archive, for example:
```
./generate_cursors.sh "~/Downloads/Metro X3 by exsess"
```
After a minute you'll have converted X11 cursors in that directory. Scroll above for installation instructions.

## About missing cursors
The original Windows cursors have much less icons than is needed for X11 environment. There is a couple of workarounds implemented in `generate_cursors.sh`:
1. Some cursors are generated by altering the existing ones with `imagemagick`.
2. One original Windows cursor is linked to several X11 cursors.

However, the following X11 cursors are still not implemented: `bottom_tee color-picker dnd-ask dnd-copy dnd-link dnd-move dnd-none dotbox dot_bot_mask draped_box icon target left_tee plus right_tee top_tee`. Since the generated cursor themes are inherited from the DMZ-White theme, all missing cursors will be taken from the parent theme.

## Thanks to
